# leastcostpath

R Implementation of Least Cost Path Analysis Functions

<b>current functions</b>
* leastcostpath - computes Least Cost Paths using multiple cost functions.
* validation_buffer - computes the accurracy of the Least Cost Path relative to another SpatialLine* object based on method proposed by Goodchild and Hunter (1997).

<b> Future functions</b>
* Incorporate 24 neighbours within LCP calculation. 60% complete.
* Implement validation method based on the distance from the optimal route (ie. straight line) and the LCP. 20% complete
